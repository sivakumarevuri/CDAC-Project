# CDAC-Project
CAN implementation for Vehicle Safety
This project implements CAN to facilitate a robust, flexible, low power and a real time system. STM32F407VGT6 is used to work as CAN nodes. Rain Water Sensor is used to detect water drops which controls Servo and temperature sensor LM35 to measure temperature which further controls the cooling system. Door lock Sensor is used to detect whether the door is locked which in turn triggers the buzzer. LDR sensor is used to measure the intensity of light which toggles the headlights of the vehicle.
